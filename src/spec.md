# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename the Pipeline page header title to display “Pipeline” instead of “Pipeline de Vendas” (header <h1> only).

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Pipeline page header <h1> text to exactly “Pipeline”.
- Leave the Pipeline page description text unchanged.
- Ensure no other labels (navigation/sidebar) or the browser tab title are modified.

**User-visible outcome:** When visiting the Pipeline page, the header title reads “Pipeline”, with all other UI text and the browser tab title remaining the same.
