  "summary": "The diff does not provide evidence that the Pipeline page <h1> header text was changed to exactly \"Pipeline\". Instead, the visible changes add board-selection persistence logic and expand URL/session parameter utilities, which go beyond the requested “header text only” change.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the Pipeline page header <h1> to display exactly \"Pipeline\" instead of \"Pipeline de Vendas\" (header only), without changing description text, nav labels, or browser tab title.",
      "reason": "The provided diff snippet for PipelinePage.tsx is truncated and does not include the header <h1> rendering. There is no explicit evidence in the shown changes that the <h1> text was modified to \"Pipeline\" or that other text was left unchanged.",
