  "summary": "The diff updates the global theme variables (Deep Indigo palette) and loads/uses Inter globally, and it replaces the Topbar logo references with new filenames. However, no new static logo assets were added under frontend/public/assets/generated (diff shows 0 added files), so the asset requirement is not met. The diff also introduces logo usage on the Login page and adds extra CSS utilities not explicitly requested.",

      "requirement": "Add the uploaded logo image as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and standardize filenames so they can be referenced by the UI.",
      "reason": "The diff summary indicates no files were added, and there is no evidence of new image assets being created under frontend/public/assets/generated. The UI now references new filenames (fy-*.png), but the corresponding static assets are not shown as added.",
